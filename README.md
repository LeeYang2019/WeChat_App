## Description
Vanilla JS with Nodejs, Express, and Socket.IO

In this project, I learned how to use Socket.IO to create a live chat app for use with my siblings during the Covid19 pandemic.

Thanks goes to Brad Traversy for his tutorial and giving me the idea.

## Goals

The following are what I learned on the project:

  Gained additional practice working on view engine templating for server side rendering.
  Gained additional practice working with Nodejs.
  Worked with socket.io.
