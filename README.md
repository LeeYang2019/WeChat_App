Vanilla JS with Nodejs, Express, and Socket.IO

In this project, I learned how to use Socket.IO to create a live chat app for use with my siblings.

Thanks goes to Brad Traversy for his tutorial and giving me the idea.

As a follow-up, I am going to create a firebase database to store the text messages and deploy the project to firebase hosting.
